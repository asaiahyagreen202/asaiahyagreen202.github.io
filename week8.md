Week 8 slipped right on by with how much time was put into completing everything required before the AI research program offically close down by the final day of July. With that reminder, group 2 had to sadly say our farewells to our graduate mentor:Blessing. She helped us as best as she could during the limited in-person time that was given to group 2. It was to no fault of either one of us since it took too long for the verification to allow her to travel back to the States from Africa. Now Blessing is persuing a research program that she was given the opportunity to join. So throughout the remainder of the week, Mr. Ron would stay to give as much advice and assistance to us as possible before the final presentation rolls around.    

We worked to finish training the YOLOv9 model that would be used in the webapp "Orchard Oracle" to finish in creating a prototype. During this timeline, we begin to put together the Final Symposium Presentation once we were given access to a copy of the template for the presentation. Along with the presentation, the research report is starting to be put together to make a full report from combining each teammate's work from the Introduction to the rest of the paper report. There is still work to finish, and it is getting a bit tense since we are working to need the deadlines. I will pose for the next week soon. Untill then!
