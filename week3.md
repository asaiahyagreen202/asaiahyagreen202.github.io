For week 3 of CEAMLS, we had a time in one of our research days where we got a spokesperson to present to us before lunch. Ms. Washington presented to use about her project of the AVAE project. It's also known as African American Vernacular English Project where they are training the AI to be able to understand black and brown language. It is an ongoing project since she working with Google currently. In Lab, we finished up working on NumPy and started to work on Panda. My group also learned a bit more on how OpenCV works by testing it out on Google Colabs. I also took time to do a bit of research on what can cause the said diseases in fruit plants and fruits. Some of them come from the various types of fungus.

For our field trip to the John Hopkins APL, it was an interesting trip. We were not able to see more of what they do face to face however, much to my slight disappointment. We were given presentations about the things that they do. Only a few of these presentations allow for us to see or interact with the products they created AI as a useful asset for providing aid for humans. The most interesting part of the field trip is the robot-dog and the AI app that can use description and drawing to make a picture. 

I will post week 4 fairly soon. Until then, have a nice Friday!
