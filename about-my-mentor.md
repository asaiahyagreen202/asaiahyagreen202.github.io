## About My Mentor and Student Mentor

My mentor, Dr. Saroj Pramanik, provides aid in giving us a detailed explaination on how plant cells are more prone to exposure to diseases than animal cells.

My student mentor, Blessing Adeika is a soon to be graduate that has been teaching us about Python cods and different data types. She is able to make things make more sense in understanding the topics at hand with coding.
