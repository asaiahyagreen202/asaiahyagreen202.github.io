It is week 10... the final days of our research AI program. I wish I could of had more time to fully say goodbye to my group. I will miss Peace for her spunk of radiance, Abigail for her mellow core, Mr. Ron for his optimal creativity, Ms. Blessing for her leading guidance, and Dr. Saroj for his meaningful advice. I believe that with the Final Symposium Presentation being a flying success, all I have to look into now is the full report(after submitting my final journal entry). I think we can submit the website as long as it can show what we were trying to do. As long as the site is up, we are good. The post-survey will be completed afterwards. I guess I'll turn in this final journal entry and spend the last day getting my certificates, my final check, and relax with my friends that are also in the SAIR program in the bearcade. 

Signing out for the final farewell...from,

A.G. aka Asaiahya Green aka Sisi
