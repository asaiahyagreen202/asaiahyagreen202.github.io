## About My Project

mBot Neo

Problem: Plants face numerous threats such as weather conditions, pests, and nutrient
deficiencies, leading to diseases. 

Approach: During this project, I will assist a team in designing a system that accomplishes the following:

  - Understanding plant leaf diseases and detection methods.
  - Acquiring and preprocessing image datasets.
  - Implementing CNNs for image classification.
  - Training and fine-tuning the model.
  - Developing the web application.
  - 

Expected Outcome: The project is expected to result into develop an automated, species-generalized disease detection system for
farmers.
