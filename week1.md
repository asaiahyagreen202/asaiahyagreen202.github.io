During the first week, I met with my mentee Ms. Blessings via zoom and my mentors to discuss the project 
that I will be working on with my group for our end of the intership project. It was a new experience for me since I had to wake up at 4:50 in the morning on the weekdays to make a train ride and a bus ride to CEAMLS Research AI program. Fortunately after the 1st week, I believe that I will continue to have an amazing experience for my 1st ever internship. I learned that the project my group will be working on is "Detection of Diseases in Plant Life"; something that sounds pretty interesting if I do say so myself. 

On top of getting to know my mentors and teammates, I also learn the boot camp of Python coding, coding with NmPy and Pandas, and with Git and Github. It was at 1st, confusing from the fast pace learning we are doing within our 1/10 weeks here that I got some coding wrong. But after talking with out with the aid of peers, I think Im starting to get the grasp of it even more. Ill give a week 2 update by next friday, see you till then.
