It's the final countdown for the ending research AI program in week 9. Throughout week 9, project group 2 has worked on the researched report and Final Symposium Presentation. Group 2 and I edited the last bit of the presentation to revise and proofread before turning it in today. It was more stressful with 3 days left of the program to go. The one thing that was frustrating is figuring out the error codes within the model when I was training it on my own terms. It was 1st from the dataset not having a constant amount of classes, then it was the wording of the code itself that prevented the model from continuing. 

Some moments I felt like giving up and not bothering to retry the code. Yet I pushed down the urge to quit when I watch a coding video that talks about ways to improve oneself while coding. It gave me the reassurance to keep at it until I finally got it to work. I might need to train the model one dataset at a time due to how long it took for it to just go through a few epochs. Sometimes, before it would get closer to being completed, the runtime of the Google Colabs disconnected from how long it would work on the training and I thought that I stopped working on the model. Also from how much information group 2 has put into the research report, it could possibly be completed before August the 2nd. I will update on the final week. Until then!üëç
