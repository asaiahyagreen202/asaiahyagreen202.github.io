It is now week 7 of our research AI program and there is still work to be done. As mentioned last week, our Mid-Summer presentation was postponed into week 7. So on Wednesday, Every group project presented on their progress made throughout the AI research program. It was nerve wrecking when it came to our turn to present. But thankfully, we pushed through with little to none hiccups. That was a weight of stress lifted off our shoulders. 

After the presentation day, group 2 has been doing more research on YOLOv9 models with going through versions of it to train with our plant leaf disease dataset. Some hiccups were finding these different models to train and work on. Fortunately, we were able to look at different YOLOv9 models to work on and train.  

With a very promising knowledge that we are offically working on the webapp. It is called: "Orchard Oracle". Mr. Ron assisted us in being able to creating it in the first place.There is still much more workd required to complete the webapp.I will return soon with the next weekly update. See you all till then!
