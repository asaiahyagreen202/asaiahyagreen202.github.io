title: Week 6

It is week 6 of our research AI program and there is still so much to do. Group 2 is finally able to get a model that we can train to later on use as the prototype for the end product of the fruit leaf disease project. Our project is working to train the dataset into the CNN model. Group 2 has also picked a title for presenting the project: "The Orchard Oracle: A Machine Learning Model for Predicting and Preventing Fruit Crop Diseases"(TM). It's catchy with inviting phrasing to bring the audience in. Speaking of audience, every group is currently practicing presenting their slides for the Mid-Summer Presentation. It is fortunate that it was postponed so every group can practice enough to feel prepared and less worried on the day that everyone presents.

Great news on what happened during this week! Blessing, My graduate mentor, was able to met our group in person! It took alot of time and waiting on group 2's end to count down the days we get to finally see her. It was very exciting, as it also felt like a present for my teammate Peace since she came to Lab on her birthday. Happy Birthday Peace! I will return soon with the next weekly update. See you all till then!
