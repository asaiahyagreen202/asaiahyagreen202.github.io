title: Week 6

It is week 6 of our research AI program and there is still so much to do. Group 2 is finally able to get a model that we can train to later on use as the prototype. Our project is working to train the dataset into the CNN model. It took three times to train the model. The initial accuracy is 61%, which isn’t as effective to work with in the real world. Fortunately, next week, we will work on the YOLOv9 model to train on. The end goal is to have a webapp CNN model up and ready for the end product of the fruit leaf disease project.

Group 2 has also picked a title for presenting the project: “The Orchard Oracle: A Machine Learning Model for Predicting and Preventing Fruit Crop Diseases”(TM). It’s catchy with inviting phrasing to bring the audience in. Speaking of the audience, every group is currently practicing presenting their slides for the Mid-Summer Presentation. It is fortunate that it was postponed so every group can practice enough to feel prepared and less worried on the day that everyone presents.

Great news on what happened during this week! Blessing, My graduate mentor was able to meet our group in person! It took a lot of time and waiting on group 2’s end to count down the days we get to finally see her. It was very exciting, as it also felt like a present for my teammate Peace since she came to Lab on her birthday. Happy Birthday Peace! I will return soon with the next weekly update. See you all till then!
