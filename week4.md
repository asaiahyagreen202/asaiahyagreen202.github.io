This week had days packed with activities and events happening. On monday we got to know how AI is impacting education all throughout the countries of the world through Dr. Riggs's presentation. In China, AI is being used to show the student's performance throughout the class to show when a student gets unfocus or not able to understand the topic of the class. Their perfomances in class is being view not only by the teachers but also the parents as well. It's concerning that there is heavy surrvailence in the schools that would test the waters. 

Ontop of that information, group 2 was able to meet up our high school teacher mentor. His told us to call him Mr. Ron. Hopefully we get to know him a bit better once he gets better (he gotten ill.). We are wrapping up doing our Pandas tutorials while touching up on OpenCV and NumhPy tutorials. The NASA trip was an intriging experience with the conversation and touring of the arces of land with the aid of the bus. At 1st there WERE NO PHOTOS till we went into buildings that allowed photography. I will be catching up on whatever I missed out on thursday as my group will be turning our video presentation and Journals. 

I will be updating with another new post for week 5 soon. Until then, have a great day!
