I have offically made it through the midpoint of the research program. Fortunately, I have just as good news to report to you all. We were able to move on from learning tutorials to checking out on types of CNN (Convultional Nerual Networks) models we could use to train it up to know how to detect the earliest sight of a plant leaf disease that is in the fruit crops. Group 2 as a whole is working on writing our papers on what we have gathered. We are finishing up on our Literature Review part of the paper.

There was a sudden announcement of news where every group would have 10 minutes to present to group of highschoolers to give them a feel of what each group is learning. I was voluntold to take lead in presentation, so I made it a more enteractive approach. I request one person to be a plant diesease, one to be a scientist(or the model) and the rest will be fruit crops. I had for the assigned parts to do certain actions while I give a narrative description of situations that calls for our role in making the model that will be used by farmers, scientist, and others who own fruit crops. 

I will be updating with another new post for week 6 soon. Until then, have a great day!
