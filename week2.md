  Today marks the 2nd week of CEAMLS. I earned my two certificated in Social and Behavior Research for Basic and Conduct. I thought that was going to be very difficult, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it was. Dr. P showed us the difference between an animal cell and a plant cell. He also showed how because of the plant cells being different from animal cells the plants can easily contract a plant disease.
