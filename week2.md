  Today marks the 2nd week of CEAMLS. I earned my two certificated in Social and Behavior Research for Basic and Conduct. I thought that was going to be very difficult, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it was. Dr. P showed us the difference between an animal cell and a plant cell. He also showed how because of the plant cells being different from animal cells the plants can easily contract a plant disease. I continue to learn more about Python with my group and Blessings, which becomes more and more fun by the day. When using examples on learning the type of Python, we use simple events that happen during the day to get a better grasp of the topic at hand; like for instance, me losing my water bottle. 

  We were introduced to OpenCV an item that talk about training the computer to be able to do an analysis scan to figure out or know wether/or not the person claims to be.
